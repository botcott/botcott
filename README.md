## About me:
I am a nodejs, python developer, I also have experience in cpp, but not much(I also work with some things in the DDNet game, bots, etc. I am also creating my own client for this game (Lunar Client).
When repositories appear, feel free to use them, but at the moment everything is done in closed repositories
## My Sites:
I also have my own website. but it is designed for the game that you can see here [click](https://lunar-client.ru/) (It is made for client installation)

Well, that's probably it, good luck to you!
