## About me:
I am a nodejs, python developer, I also have experience in cpp, but not much(
I'm working with some things in the DDNet game, bots, etc.
I also make my own client for this game (Lunar Client)
When repositories appear, feel free to use them :3
But at the moment everything is done in private repositories

That's it, good luck to you!
